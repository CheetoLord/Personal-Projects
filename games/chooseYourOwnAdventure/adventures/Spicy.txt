Not trusting whoever has put you in this place,
You try to open the window.
Unfortunately, it is locked.
Undetered, you back up, and throw yourself through the window.
This makes a loud noise, and you know you have to act fast.
The new large room you have found yourself in has two doors,
As well as what looks to be a control panel of sorts to your right.

You burst through the door on your left.
You close the door behind you, only to be left in total darkness.

Once you find it, you flick it and wheel around.

It shoots you. You die.

You rush through the door on the right,
only to be greeted by a suspiciously empty rooom.
You start hearing cracks above you, and looking up,
you see that something is about to crash through the ceiling.
Before you can react, a tank falls on top of you.
You are instantly flattened. You die.

tesla tank die
----story----
You flip the switch labeled "Lightning" to on.
As you do, the wall in front of you begins to retract
into the ceiling, revealing a tank with a tesla coil on
top of it instead of a gun. You hear a low pitched warbling
coming from it, and you realize that it is charging up.
Without a second to lose, you rush to the nearest door,
but it is already too late. The tesla coil discharges into
you, instantly frying your organs and cooking you to a
medium rare. You die.

noise alert die
----story----
You turn the dial labeled "Bass" to the notch labeled "11".
Instantly you hear heavy dubstep blasting from the panel in
front of you. While you are worried about being caught, this
is the best song you have ever heard. You decide that you
can spend a second jamming out to it. A second turns into a
minute, which turns into a couple minutes, which turns into
twenty. The song finally ends, and you decide to get back
to escaping. You turn around to see your other options,
and you see about a dozen tanks aimed right at you from the
next room over, where there was once a wall. They all shoot
you. You die.
